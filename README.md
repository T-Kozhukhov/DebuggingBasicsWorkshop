# DebuggingBasicsWorkshop
Small workshop for sharing amongst Shendruk Lab on the fundamentals of debugging.
Quick start from here TODO

This is a series of exercises designed to introduce you to the basics of debugging.
These are based around using some variety of **visual** debugger, as opposed to a purely terminal based one.
Tutorials will be based off using the Visual Studio Code (VSC) debugging interface for convenenience but principles should also apply to other IDEs.
